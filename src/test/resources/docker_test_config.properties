# zeroDateTimeBehavior: Change the behavior of date 0000-00-00 to automatically become a valid date by rounding. The
#                       new default is to throw an exception, whereas previous versions of Connector/J converted to
#                       null. For type safety and to lower the number of exceptions thrown by OSCAR, round is the
#                       logical choice.
# useOldAliasMetadataBehavior: Due to issues with Hibernate column mapping, queries which rename columns will cause
#                              Hibernate to throw an exception. Previous version of Connector/J used a different
#                              method of determining column names which allowed the renaming of columns.
# jdbcCompliantTruncation: Fields which are not included in a query, and do not contain a default value in the database,
#                          will raise an exception in the JDBC specification. Previous versions of Connector/J
#                          were not JDBC compliant and did not follow the truncation specifications.
# IMPORTANT: The fields listed after the ? are required! Otherwise, OSCAR will not behave properly as it depends on
#            legacy functionality. Ensure that you leave the tags behind the field when renaming the database.
